= JsonRpc

This is a complete implementation of the JSON-RPC 1.1 protocol, as described in
the JSON-RPC 1.1 Specification of 7 August 2007, which may be found at
http://json-rpc.org/wd/JSON-RPC-1-1-WD-20060807.html.

The implementation consists of two parts: a service side and a client side. The
server part is written specifically for Ruby on Rails, but the client does not really
require Rails. A Rails application may choose to act as a service provider,
as a client, or both.


== Server Side

A Rails app may host any number of services. A service is declared in a controller,
e.g.:

	class ExampleServiceController < ApplicationController
  
	  json_rpc_service :name => 'DemoService',                                 # required
	                   :id => 'urn:uuid:fdba4820-276b-11dc-ab85-0002a5d5c51b', # required
	                   :version => '0.1',                                      # optional
	                   :summary => 'A simple demonstration service.',          # optional
	                   :help => 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/services/index.html',   # optional
	                   :address => 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/services'            # optional

	  json_rpc_procedure :name => 'sum', :proc => :+,                          # required
	                     :summary => 'Sums two numbers.',                      # optional
	                     :help => 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/services/sum.html',   # optional
	                     :idempotent => true,                                  # optional
	                     :params => [{:name => 'a', :type => 'num'},           # optional
	                                 {:name => 'b', :type => 'num'}],          # optional
	                     :return => {:type => 'num'}                           # optional

	  json_rpc_procedure :name => 'time', :proc => lambda { Time.now.to_s }
  
	end
	
For the exact meaning of the args, read the JSON-RPC 1.1 specification - it's very
straightforward. 

Create a controller for each service you need. Then declare routes for them in Rails'
config/routes.rb file:

	ActionController::Routing::Routes.draw do |map|
  
	  map.connect 'services/*method', :controller => 'example_service', 
	              :action => 'receive_json_rpc_request'

	end

+services+ is the external name of the service (it can be anything, of course). 
The complete URI to your service will be something like http://www.yoursite.com/services.

Please note that the +:action+ arg must have the exact value indicated above, and the
route string must end with '/*method'. In future versions there might be a helper to 
create JSON-RPC routes, but as yet that piece of syntactic sugar is not available.


== Client Side

The client side of things is the module JsonRpcClient. To connect to a service as defined
above (locally on your computer or anywhere in the world), define a class to encapsulate
your remote calls:


	class Yonder < JsonRpcClient
	  json_rpc_service 'http://www.yoursite.com/services'
	end
			
You can now call procedures remotely on your new class as the receiving object:

	Yonder.time
	Yonder.sum 24, 6
	Yonder.sum :a => 24, :b => 6
	Yonder.sum :b => 6, :a => 24
	Yonder.sum :b => 6, '0' => 24
	Yonder.sum '0' => 24, '1' => 6
	
Note that all the calls to +sum+ are equivalent. For further information, see the JSON-RPC 1.1 
specifications. The use of named arguments is encouraged.

NB: If at all possible, use an IP number in the URI instead of a host name, as the Net::HTTP
library can be slow in resolving addresses, which may render your requests two magnitudes 
slower.

Also note that your JSON-RPC client class, "Yonder" in this example, never is instantiated.

You can also pass a one-argument block to a remote procedure call:

	Yonder.foo(bar, baz) { |x| x.kind_of?(Exception) ? scream(x) : process(x) }
	
If a block is present, the result of executing +foo+ on +bar+ and +baz+ will be yielded to the
block. However, if for any reason an exception should occur at any point, including HTTP setup,
remote evaluation or decoding of the JSON reply, the block will instead receive the exception.
This allows you to program continuation style, or to implement execution queues for retries, etc.


=== Service Description

When the client is created, it will connect to its service and download its Service Description.
This makes the JSON-RPC 1.1 client interface self-configuring. You can obtain the Service Description
object by calling

 	Yonder.system_describe

which will return a hash. The JSON-RPC specification requires that this method be called
'system.describe', but as this is not possible in Ruby the period has been replaced by an
underline character. This is only on the Ruby client side; the server, which is completely
standard compliant, will of course respond as required to 'system.describe'.


=== Parameter coercion

Limited conversion between parameter types will be performed: the JSON-RPC interface will convert
between numeric and string types as necessary, provided there is no ambiguity and no loss of precision.
Parameter types are checked by the services and errors returned if there is a type mismatch - except
for strings and numbers as described above.


=== GET and POST

The plugin will make GET requests for procedures which are known to be idempotent (roughly: which
return the same result for the same parameters always, and which do not mutate any data). Procedures
are declared idempotent on the service side. For all other procedures the plugin will choose do to
a POST. They are equivalent in speed, but GET posts have the added advantage of being cacheable by
proxies, etc.


=== Speed

The JSON-RPC 1.1 protocol is very lightweight. The JSON-RPC server side, under Rails, is able to
process about 4000 requests per second on my 2.16 GHz Intel Core Duo iMac. The client side is
comparable in speed, but the determining factor in this case is the Net:HTTP library, which can be
unnecessarily slow. It is important to use an IP number instead of a host name, for instance. On
my system, the client side can generate between 500 and 1000 requests per second. Note that these
figures apply to the production environment, not the development environment, which of course is
slower.

In future, a different HTTP library than Net::HTTP may be used on the client side.
